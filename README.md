## Introduction

Welcome to the VW RDC300 Car Radio Upgrade Project! This project aims to modernize and improve the functionality of the VW RDC300 car radio while retaining the original chassis and connectors. We invite you to collaborate with us and contribute to this open-source endeavor.

## Project Overview

The VW RDC300 car radio, model 1K0 035 186T, is a popular radio unit in many Volkswagen vehicles. Over time, it has become outdated in terms of features and technology. Our goal is to update this radio by designing a 3D model for the front panel and creating a new PCB with modern functionalities.

## Scope

The scope of this project includes:

- Designing a 3D model for the front panel that seamlessly fits into the existing car radio chassis.
- Developing a new PCB (Printed Circuit Board) with up-to-date features and microcontroller support.
- Writing the necessary code and firmware for the microcontroller to operate the upgraded radio features.
- Ensuring compatibility with popular hardware and components for ease of sourcing and assembly.
- Maintaining the same connectors to ensure a drop-in replacement for the original unit.
- Keeping the project open-source and welcoming contributions from the community.

# Technical Journey
## Overview

Microchip IoT Developer Guides for AWS is a set of hands-on tutorials and technical articles curated to help you get started with integrated IoT design. You will start at the sandbox, where you can explore sending and receiving data to the cloud with almost no setup. When you are ready, you will securely connect the node to your own AWS account and build an example application. All of the tutorials, as well as the recommended reading path, can be seen in the Map of Resources. A short description of each tutorial can also be found in the List of Tutorials section.
